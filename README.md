## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Data Science Fellow at The Knowledge House and a Compliance Booking Representative at Laufer Group International. I specialize in Python, SQL, and stakeholder-oriented analysis, with a passion for building tools that improve efficiency and equity in student services and public sector workflows.

I thrive at the intersection of data and impact: whether I’m segmenting student outcomes in PostgreSQL, visualizing enrollment trends in pandas, or crafting stakeholder narratives that drive action, I bring rigor, empathy, and strategic communication to every project.

I’m also a creative thinker — from designing symbolic logos to exploring consumer behavior through data storytelling, I love blending analytical precision with visual and narrative clarity.

Currently, I’m deepening my skills in clustering, NLP, and modular Python workflows, while preparing for roles in analytics, compliance, and public sector operations in NYC.
